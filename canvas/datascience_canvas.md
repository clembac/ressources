## Decision

*How are predictions used to
make decisions that provide
the proposed value to the end-user?*

```

```

## Data science Task

*Input, analysis/output to predict, type of problem.*

```
WRITE HERE
```

## Value propositions

*What are we trying to do for the end-user(s) of the predictive system? What objectives are we serving?*

```
WRITE HERE
```


## Data sources

*Which raw data sources can we use (internal and external)?*

```
WRITE HERE
```
## Collecting Data

*How do we get new data to learn from (inputs and outputs)?*

```
WRITE HERE
```

## Making Predictions

*When do we make predictions on new inputs? How long do we have to featurize a new input and make a prediction?*

```
WRITE HERE
```


## Offline Evaluation

*Methods and metrics to evaluate the system before deployment.*

```
WRITE HERE
```

## Features

*Input representations extracted from raw data sources.*

```
WRITE HERE
```


## Building models

*When do we create/update
models with new training
data? How long do we have to featurize training inputs and create a model?*

```
WRITE HERE
```

## List evaluation and moniroting

*Methods and metrics to evaluate the system after deployment, and to quantify value creation.*
